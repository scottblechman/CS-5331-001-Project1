The house is made up of two main parts: the living area (and kitchen) and bedroom. The living area has a TV with a couch,
as well as an interactive record player and various wall art. The kitchen is defined by a bar area complete with barstools,
 as well as the essentials such as an oven and microwave. Near the kitchen is a circular dining table, with four evenly
 spaced chairs.
 
 The bedroom keeps the bed and end tables near the corner of the room, providing space for a desk and dresser, as well
 as a guitar stand.
